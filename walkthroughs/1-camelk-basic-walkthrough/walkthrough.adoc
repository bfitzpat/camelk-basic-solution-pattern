Learn how to create a simple Apache Camel K integration so you can learn about important features before jumping into more complex examples.

In this Solution Pattern, you will be creating a simple Greeter application that says 'Hello, customer!' every few seconds.

*Creating a new project in OpenShift*
****

Follow these steps to create a new project.

. Go to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"]
. Create a new project named `camel-basic`. Go to `Home->Projects` and click the `Create Project` button.
. Monitor the OpenShift Console until a green check mark is displayed beside the new project.

Look at the link:openshift-console-url: {openshift-host}/projects[OpenShift, window="_blank"] console. Do you see your newly created project displayed in the *Projects* list?

== Creating your project in VS Code or your Preferred IDE
:task-context: vs-code

Follow these steps on your local machine to create and deploy your integration in your preferred IDE.

Open your preferred IDE. For *VS Code* or *Red Hat Code Ready Workspaces*:

. Install the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-didact[Didact extension by Red Hat]
. Install the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.apache-camel-extension-pack[Extension Pack for Apache Camel by Red Hat]
. Find the *Didact Tutorials* view, navigate to `Apache Camel K -> Starting a new Camel K Route (Solution Pattern)`. Swipe right and click the Start Didact Tutorial button.
. Work through the `Starting a new Camel K Route` tutorial.

{bl}
Or, use your preferred development environment with access to Camel K, do the following:

. Open a new Terminal window.
. Ensure that you have access to the `kamel` command-line tool and that it is connected to your running OpenShift instance by typing `kamel version`. (See the link:https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/installation/installation.html[Apache Camel K Installation documentation for help.])
. Type `kamel init Greeter.java` to create a new Java route that puts a message in the log once per second.
. Type `kamel run Greeter.java` to start the Integration.
. To verify that the integration is running, type `kamel get` to get a list of the integrations currently running or starting up.
. When the integration is in the status *Running*, you can view the log for the integration by typing `kamel log Greeter`.

Return to Solution Explorer when you are done.

Look at the link:openshift-console-url: {openshift-host}/dashboards[OpenShift, window="_blank"] console. Drill down into the `Operators->Installed Operators` list for the `camel-basic` project. Do you see your new integration in the *Integration* list?

== Find Your Running Camel K Integration
:task-context: run-camel

Follow these steps to verify that your integration is running in the OpenShift console.

. Open the OpenShift link:{openshift-host}/console[Console, window="_blank"]
. In the `Workloads->Pods` list, look for a pod that starts with `greeter-` and click on it.
. Click on the Logs tab and view the running log for your route. You should see similar output to what you witnessed in your IDE or terminal window.
